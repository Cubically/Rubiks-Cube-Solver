Optimal Rubik's Cube Solver

REQUIREMENTS
============
* A C compiler w/ standard libraries, I use gcc
* make
* python to run the cube_convert.py script

TO COMPILE
==========
1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed as well as standard library headers.
   You will also need the "make" program. No other fancy libraries are needed.

2. Run the "make" command in the source directory to compile all the files.
   This will produce a program called "main" which is used to generate the
   heuristics tables and to solve the cube

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
===================
First you will need to generate the heuristics tables. This could take a while.
 1. Run the compiled program with "./main"
 2. Select one of the three table generation options.
 3. Wait.
 4. Repeat 1-3 for the other two tables 

Verify the table generation worked with these md5 signatures:

906e22b7df87e25945eff80cd228323c  table_corner.rht
70f82a8a0810b30ed47eebefe74e25cb  table_edge1.rht
2164d32703941aee8a4218bae595d944  table_edge2.rht

Next obtain a physical scrambled cube to solve, and run the cube_convert.py
script to generate the formatted cube string.

The cube_convert.py script gives you this template:

              1   2   3

              4   R   5

              6   7   8

 9  10  11   12  13  14   15  16  17    18  19  20

21   B  22   23   W  24   25   G  26    27   Y  28

29  30  31   32  33  34   35  36  37    38  39  40

             41  42  43

             44   O  45

             46  47  48

And asks you to enter in the given order the color of each face. You don't need
to enter the center faces, those are fixed, so skip over those.
For example, a solved cube would be entered like this:
rrrrrrrrbbbwwwgggyyybbwwggyybbbwwwgggyyyoooooooo
Which gets translated to:
nnbyonnnnyonnnnyognnbynnnnnyngnrbynnnrnynnnrnyngnnbnonnnnnog
nrbnnnnrnnngwnbnonwnnnonwnnnogwnbnnnwnnnngwrbnnnwrnnnnwrnnng
(except all on one line) 

Finally, to solve a cube:
Run the compiled program "./main" and choose the solve a cube option.
Paste in your translated 120 character cube string all on one line and press
enter.

Wait for solutions!

I wrote this program completely from scratch, using ideas from Richard Korf's
papers and other various internet resources. Any ideas, interesting comments,
