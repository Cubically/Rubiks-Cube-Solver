/*
 * corner_hash
 * Input: a cube_type string
 * Output: An integer in the range 0 to 88179840-1
 *
 * The general method is to process the first 7 of the 8 corner cubies.
 * For the first corner cube, since it has 24 possible positions, the
 * hash space is split into 24 even sections (3674160 elements long)
 * A number is calculated 0 through 23 that represents which position
 * the first corner cubie is in, and multiplied by 3674160, which becomes
 * the index.
 *
 * Then the second corner cube is similar, except the remaining space (which
 * is 3674160 elements long) is split into 21 equal parts, since the second
 * corner cubie has 21 possible positions.  That works out to 174960.  So,
 * similarly, a number 0-20 is calculated and multiplied by 174960 and then
 * added to the index.  This is repeated for each of the first 7 corner
 * cubies. The eighth cubie has only 1 possible position, so it is not
 * included in any calculations. (It cannot be rotated but one way since
 * the cube would not be solvable)
 *
 * This method takes about 37 mins on my 2GHz Intel T7200
